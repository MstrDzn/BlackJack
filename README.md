<h1>BlackJack</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
It is the project that has taught me the most abougt coding, the codes are kind of dense and this project really allowed me to improve a lot. It is a blackjack game, with music and homemade visuals. I invite you to test it if you can (don't forget to install pygame) to be in the thing with the music and all!

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Python</b>
- <b>Adobe Photoshop</b>


<h2>Project walk-through</h2>

Once the view.py file is executed, this screen will be displayed indicating the player to click the screen to start the game<br/>

Now, music begins and the board is displayed. Following the BlackJack rules, you can choose to draw a card or stay by clicking the buttons while taking the risk to be above 21<br/>

<br />
<br />
Once you stay, the bot will begin to draw cards until it is close enough to 21, taking the risk to draw too much and loosing<br/>

<br />
This screen appears if you win, and another one if you loose, also letting you restart the game by only clicking the 'recommencer' button (it was the trickiest part to code)<br/>

And there is even a special screen with a special music if you manage to get a BlackJack ! Try it yourself! <br/>
